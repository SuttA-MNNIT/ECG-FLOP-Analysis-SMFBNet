# ECG-FLOP-Analysis-SMFBNet
A PyTorch implementation of a multi-branch CNN-GRU architecture for ECG classification with computational profiling using THOP. The model supports both full-lead (12-lead) and reduced-lead (SMFB-Net) configurations to evaluate FLOPs, parameter counts, and efficiency trade-offs.
